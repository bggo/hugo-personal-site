# Courses and Habits investments during the year

I always loved to learn. Anything. From IT technical stuff from bike mechanics, cooking and many other things. I guess I’m just too curious and wanna understand how stuff works. 

## Courses

# Conclusion

2020 was a challenging year, but I provoked myself to be positive and tried to connect myself to new habits. Learning and trying different kinds of exercises was the focus, and as you are here, you may understand that writing has started to become a focus too. 

Thank you for reading this post, hope you enjoyed it.
