      <description>The journey of constant learning It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 2 year that I decided to give myself a different life. Not a life with limitations, or without the things that gives me most pleasure, materially and spiritually, but a life full of awareness, seeking my true purposes.
I never gave personal habits truly importance. In every single aspect, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to stop what I was doing to plan, think or even understand the colateral effects of my daily actions.</description>
